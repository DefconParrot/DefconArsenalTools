![JOS_Spooky_authentication_at_a_distance_v01 - Tamas Jos - Spooky authentication at a distance pdf](https://github.com/DefconParrot/DefconArsenalTools/assets/30528167/082adc76-da86-40bd-b5d5-6d3987531edc)

A new technique that allows you to:

- Use the authentication context of a domain user, of a remote machine, from
  your own computer.

Requirements:

- Small agent running on target machine
- No dumping of credentials, in fact we won’t be seeing any plaintext credentials
- No administrator privileges required
- No special permissions required (e.g. special tokens etc.)
- No exploits, everything that will be shown here is “by-design”
