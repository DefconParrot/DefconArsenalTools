## Tool Description
![Veilid](https://veilid.com/img/Veilid.svg)

[Veilid is an open-source, peer-to-peer, mobile-first networked application framework](https://veilid.com/), with a flagship secure messaging application named VeilidChat. Veilid is conceptually similar to IPFS + Tor, but faster and designed from the ground-up to provide all services over a privately routed network. The network also enables development of distributed applications without a 'blockchain' or a 'transactional layer' at their base. Veilid can be included as part of user-facing applications or run as a standalone server for power users who wish to help build the network.
