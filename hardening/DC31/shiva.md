## Tool Description

**Title** : Revolutionizing ELF binary patching with Shiva By ElfMaster

![DEF CON 31 - Revolutionizing ELF binary patching w Shiva - ElfMaster](https://github.com/DefconParrot/DefconArsenalTools/assets/30528167/8450a89f-f05a-49f0-ba16-fa6e77fc6d2a)

Shiva is a JIT binary patching system for ELF; A custom ELF interpreter that loads and links ELF relocatable patches atruntime. Shiva allows developers to write patches in rich C code to naturally express the rewriting of binary code atruntime, in a high level language. ELF binary patching solutions over the past two decades have been scarce; somenotable research: Katana and ERESI come to mind as pioneers in the early examples of custom ELF linkers and binarypatchers.

Shiva is a next-level solution that allows developers to quickly write patches in C with little to no reversing knowledge. Born out of 16 years of ELF research into virus design, binary patching, and extensive experience with writing custom linkers and loaders.

## Author Description

- _Ryan “ElfMaster” O’Neill_ is the founder and CTO of [Arcana Technologies](https://arcana-technologies.io) & [Arcana Research](https://arcana-research.io).
- He has been in the security scene since about 1997 and is well known for authoring the famous book title "Learning Linux binary analysis" and for publishing many papers and technologies in the realm of binary protection, memory forensics, exploitation, security mitigations, virus design, kernel hacking and reverse engineering techniques. _Ryan_ has also been published in many of the classic journals such as Phrack, POC||GTFO, tmp.0ut and vxheaven. Much of Ryan's independent research has been published over the years on https://www.bitlackeys.org, and has many public technologies available on https://github.com/elfmaster, and he has just released a new ELF binary patching system "[Shiva](https://github.com/advanced-microcode-patching/shiva)" for Linux to solve the worlds hardest challenges in binary patching today.
