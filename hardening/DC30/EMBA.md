Category: hardening

Tags: Exploitation, bypass, hacking

Tool Presented at: DEF CON 30

Author/Presenter: [Michael Messner](#), [Pascal Eckmann](#)

## Tool Description

Penetration testing of current embedded devices is quite complex as we have to deal with different architectures, optimized operating systems and special protocols. EMBA is an open-source firmware analyzer with the goal to simplify, optimize and automate the complex task of firmware security analysis.
