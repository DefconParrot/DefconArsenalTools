## Tool Description

![WiGLE Bottle V2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fvo2tlzWwAQbwJ1?format=jpg&name=large)

A Raspberry Pi 4 Wigle Bottle USB 2 breakout board that increases the spacing of the traditional Raspberry Pi 4 USB 2 ports which do not support USB 3 on the ports that do -- for reasons. Primary design of the board is for an [WiGLE](https://wigle.net) collector using USB dongles as data sources (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS) in a portable form factor. Boards are shared on OSH Park and can be ordered here in sets of three: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/4ibeuOBA.
