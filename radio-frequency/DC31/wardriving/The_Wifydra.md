The Wifydra is open source hardware and software used to locate wireless access points for wardriving. The project is a continuation of the work done previously by Mike Spicer (d4rkm4tter) and his WiFi Cactus and Kraken. Designed to be a low power and low cost modular way of simultaneously monitoring all 2.4Ghz WiFi channels for AP beacons. By utilizing strictly off the shelf embedded components, the Wifydra is able to keep costs extremely low (~$90) and its footprint extremely small (250 square cm). More importantly, minimal power consumption is maintained, requiring only a USB C battery capable of putting out 10 watts. The Wifydra is modular in nature and supports a multitude of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) options for location tagging. The ESP32-C5 for 5Ghz channel monitoring will also be supported once the hardware becomes available. The version of The Wifydra demoed consists of 14 ESP8266 called sub nodes, an additional ESP32 called the dom node, SD card holder, GNSS module, OLED screen, as well as the Wifydra carrier board that connects all these components.
