## Tool Description

Many pentesters are avoiding existing frameworks due to security improvements from Microsoft and smarter practices by network Admins. Red teams don’t have to throw away existing tools because their attacks are being thwarted and contrary to belief, Powershell is not dead. We updated existing tools and demonstrated that they can still be used to launch successful attacks. We would want to get back to the basics and demonstrate that successful attacks are still possible by modifying tools like Empire.
