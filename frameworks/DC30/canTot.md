## Tool Description

canTot is a cli framework similar to the usage of known frameworks like Metasploit, dronesploit, expliot, and Recon-ng. The fun thing is that it contains fun hacks and known vulnerabilities disclosed. It can also be used as a guide for pentesting vehicles and learning python for Car Hacking the easier way. This is not to reinvent the wheel of known CAN fuzzers, car exploration tools like caring caribou, or other great CAN analyzers out there. But to combine all the known vulnerabilities and fun CAN bus hacks in automotive security.
