## Tool Description
EDRSandBlast is a tool written in C that implements and industrializes known as well as original bypass techniques to make EDR evasion easier during adversary simulations. Both user-land and kernel-land EDR detection capabilities can be bypassed, using multiple unhooking techniques and a vulnerable signed driver to unregister kernel callbacks and disable the ETW Threat Intelligence provider. Since the initial release, multiple improvements have been implemented in EDRSandBlast: it is now possible to use this toolbox as a library from another attacking tool, new bypasses have been implemented, the embedded vulnerable driver is now interchangeable to increase stealthiness and the use of a pre-built offsets database is no more required! Come discover our tool and its new features, learn (or teach us!) something about EDRs and discuss about the potential improvements to this project.
