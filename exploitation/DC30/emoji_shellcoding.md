## Tool Description
Shellcodes are short executable stubs that are used in various attack scenarios, whenever code execution is possible. After quickly recalling what a shellcode is and why designing shellcodes under constraints is an art, we'll study a new constraint for which (to the best of our knowledge) no such shellcode was previously known: emoji shellcoding. We'll tackle this problem by introducing a new and more generic approach to shellcoding under constraints. Brace yourselves, you'll see some black magic weaponizing these cute little emojis 🥰 into merciless exploits 👿.
