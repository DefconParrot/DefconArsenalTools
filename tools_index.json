Both user-land and kernel-land EDR detection capabilities can be bypassed, using multiple unhooking techniques and a vulnerable signed driver to unregister kernel callbacks and disable the ETW Threat Intelligence provider. Since the initial release, multiple improvements have been implemented in EDRSandBlast: it is now possible to use this toolbox as a library from another attacking tool, new bypasses have been implemented, the embedded vulnerable driver is now interchangeable to increase stealthiness and the use of a pre-built offsets database is no more required! Come discover our tool and its new features, learn (or teach us!) something about EDRs and discuss about the potential improvements to this project.",

We'll tackle this problem by introducing a new and more generic approach to shellcoding under constraints.

The project is a continuation of the work done previously by Mike Spicer (d4rkm4tter) and his WiFi Cactus and Kraken. Designed to be a low power and low cost modular way of simultaneously monitoring all 2.4Ghz WiFi channels for AP beacons. By utilizing strictly off the shelf embedded components, the Wifydra is able to keep costs extremely low (~$90) and its footprint extremely small (250 square cm). More importantly, minimal power consumption is maintained, requiring only a USB C battery capable of putting out 10 watts. The Wifydra is modular in nature and supports a multitude of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) options for location tagging. The ESP32-C5 for 5Ghz channel monitoring will also be supported once the hardware becomes available. The version of The Wifydra demoed consists of 14 ESP8266 called sub nodes, an additional ESP32 called the dom node, SD card holder, GNSS ",
