## Tool Description

A Commodore 64 Virus Analysis

Why looking into a 30 years old "malicious" software make sense in 2022? Because this little "jewels", written in a bunch of bytes, reached a level of complexity surprisingly high. With no other reason than pranking people or show off technical knowledge, this software show how much you can do with very limited resources: this is inspiring for us, looking at modern malicious software, looking at how things are done and how the same things could have been done instead.

## Author BIO(S):

- _Cesare Pizzi_ is a Security Researcher, Analyst, and Technology Enthusiast at Sorint.lab.

- He develops software and hardware, and tries to share this with the community. Mainly focused on low level programming, he develops and contributes to OpenSource software (Volatility, OpenCanary, Cetus, etc), sometimes hardware related (to interface some real world devices) sometimes not. Doing a lot of reverse engineering too, so he feels confident in both "breaking" and "building" (may be more on breaking?).
