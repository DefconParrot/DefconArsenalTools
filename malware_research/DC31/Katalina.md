## Tool Description

Katalina: an open-source Android string deobfuscator

Katalina is like Unicorn but for Dalvik bytecode. It provides an environment that can execute Android bytecode one instruction at a time.

Android malware has long relied on basic string obfuscation techniques to make analysts suffer while deobfuscating it. Right now, there are very few free tools that can deobfuscate Android malware. Because of that, the Android malware ecosystem is severely skewed in favor of the attackers and/or big corporations that can handle the man hours/have the big bucks needed for the commercial tools. Katalina tries to fix that, by giving the community a free tool that researchers can extend and enrich.
